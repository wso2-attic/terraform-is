# Terraform Resources for WSO2 Identity Server

## Installation

### Prerequisites

* Install and set up [Packer](https://www.packer.io/) (>= v1.4.0 )
* Install and set up [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) (>= v0.12.00 )


### Instructions:

1. Download the WSO2  Identity Server terraform resource.

  ```bash
   $ git clone https://github.com/wso2/terraform-is.git
  ```

   $ packer build centos-base.json 
   ```

3. Changed the directory to `azure-simple/terraform` and update the build `baseimage` in `variables.tf` and `terraform.tfvars` files inclusive of Azure subscription credentials.

   ```bash
   $ terraform apply  
   ```

   **Note:**  Add the host entry `<PUBLIC-IP> is.wso2test.com` in `/etc/hosts` file to access the WSO2 Identity Server console.
